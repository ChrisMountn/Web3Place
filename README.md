# Web3Place
Solidity Project - This is the backend for a pixel-auction site like r/place or the million dollar homepage I am creating. Repository is still in testing and subject to change.

Users can buy pixels from the original deployer of the contract, for 1 unit (currently set at 1 ether in the script for convenience, but this is probably too high). Other users can buy currently owned pixels, but must pay 1 unit more than the pixel was previously bought for. The owner of a pixel can change the colour at any time. I am aiming to build the frontend for this DAPP using web3.js soon.
